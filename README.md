<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a title="200 hour yoga teacher training in Rishikesh" href="https://www.himalayanyogaashram.com/200-hour-vinyasa-flow-yoga-teacher-training-in-rishikesh/">200 hour yoga teacher training in Rishikesh</a> is a basic course that prepares aspiring yogis to become professional yoga teachers with an overall knowledge on asanas as well as other aspects of yoga.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Real meaning of yoga</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The common perception of yoga is limited to asanas which is actually not the case. There are three aspects included in yoga : physical , mental and spiritual. Pranayama (breathing exercise) is an equally important element of the subject which is most often ignored when one talks about yoga. The real meaning of yoga is thus hidden.&nbsp; The real meaning of yoga has been disclosed in the Vedas (ancient texts). The traditional concept of yoga lays emphasis on the Vedas. It allows a deep understanding about the path of yoga and enables a better way of practice of the subject. The student becomes more confident. His yogic knowledge gets strengthened and he becomes capable enough to talk about the art and&nbsp; science of yoga to others be it in any part of the world. Besides asanas, a yoga teacher training will enlighten you on how it is beneficial in your daily life, how you can implement it to lead a balanced and happy life and how you can transform your life as well as the lives of others around you.</span></p>
